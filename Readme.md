# LightTheWorld Frame Generator


Simple client-side web app. Replace `assets/frame.png` with your transparent PNG frame. Deploy on any static host (Netlify, GitHub Pages, Vercel). No backend required.


**How to run locally**
1. Put your `frame.png` into the `assets/` folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.


**Notes**
- Keep the canvas size at 1080×1080 for good export quality.
- Test on mobile (Safari/Chrome) — pointer events are used for touch support.
